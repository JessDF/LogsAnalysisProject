# LogsAnalysisProject
Udacity Fullstack Web Development Nanodegree Program - Project 5: Log Analysis


## PROMPT
Your task is to create a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.

## SETTING UP THE ENVIRONMENT
To help with the setup of this project, you are provided with a vagrantfile
and two SQL scripts to set up the environment as intended for this project.  

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install.
2. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice.

   Now that you have everything in place, it's time to set up your virtual environment.
   
3. `cd` into `<FolderName>`:
   ```sh
   $ cd <FolderName>
   ```

4. Setting up Vagrant:
   ```sh
   $ vagrant up
   ```
   Once `vagrant up` has finished, you will see your shell prompt.

5. Log in to the virtual machine:
   ```sh
   $ vagrant ssh
   ```
   
6. Once logged in, navigate to the shared directory:
   ```sh
   cd /vagrant
   ```

7. Extract the newsdata SQL script and use it to populate the database with test data:
   ```sh
   $ unzip newsdata.zip
   $ psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
   ```

8. Set up the views needed to query the database:
   ```sh
   $ psql -d news -f createviews.sql
   ```
9. Lastly, run logs.py:
   ```sh
   $ python3 logs.py
   ```

## PROJECT PURPOSE
This project was designed to answer 3 questions about a fictional news website's traffic:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## MENTION
Did have trouble with the createviews.sql file, got help from a professor. This helped me clean up my logs.py file as well.
Clean up of logs.py isn't documented on my gitHub as the bash shell wouldn't push with the vagrant files in it.
